    Mixup - a language for pattern-matching and extraction on sequences of tokens.

    <h1>The Text Package</h1>

    <h2>Basic Concepts In this Package</h2>
    
    <p>
    A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextToken} is a "token" (usually a single word in a
    document), plus some additional information that allows one to
    find out where this word/token occured. Specifically one can
    recover the string that contained the token, a shorter string
    <em>identifier</em> of this "document" string, and the character
    offsets of the token--i.e., where it appeared in the document
    string.

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.Span} is a sequence of adjacent TextTokens from the
    same document.

    <p>Spans and TextTokens are considered to be inheritantly ordered.
    If two Spans or TextTokens are from different document, they are
    ordered lexigraphically based on the <em>identifiers</em> of those
    documents.  Within a single document, TextTokens are according
    to their position in their document, and Spans are ordered
    according to their leftmost TextToken (using the rightmost
    TextToken to break ties.)

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextBase} is a collection of tokenized "document"
    strings, accessible as Spans.

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextEnv} contains <em>markup</em> for
    a {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextBase}.  This markup can consist of
      <ul>
      <li>String-valued properties of individual TextTokens (i.e.,
      individual occurances in the TextBase of words.)  
      <li>String-valued properties of Spans of TextTokens in the
      TextBase.
      <li>Groupings of Spans into "types".  A Span can belong to
	multiple types, and unlike properties, it is possible to
	quickly find all Spans of a given type in a TextEnv, or
	find all Spans of a given type in a specific document.
      </ul>
    There are a couple of different varieties of TextEnv's.  An {@link
    edu.cmu.minorthird.text.txt.ImmutableTextEnv} can only be read, not modified.
    A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.MonotonicTextEnv} can be modified by
    changing attribute values, adding new attribute values, or adding
    Spans to a type; however, Spans cannot be removed from a type.  A
    plain old {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextBase} allows spans to be
    removed from a type as well.

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.NestedTextEnv} is an odd sort of
    implementation of a MonotonicTextEnv. It combines two TextEnv's,
    an "inner" one and an "outer" one, such that the outer one can be
    monotonically added to, but the inner one is never modified.
    Semantically, the markup in a NestedTextEnv is the union of the
    markup in the inner and outer TextEnv's, except that property
    values in the outer TextEnv "shadow" values in the inner TextEnv.

      This has several possible uses, for instance:
      <ol>
      <li>One can add change a TextEnv and then "back out" the changes
      by (a) creating NestedTextEnv with an empty "outer"
      MonotonicTextEnv, (b) monotonically adding to this new "outer"
      TextEnv, and then (c) discarding the NestedTextEnv and reverting
      to the old "inner" TextEnv to undo the modifications.  

      <li>One can easily construct and view the union of two TextEnv's
      (or at least, some well-defined approximation of this), which
      still being able to modify either underlying TextEnv.  For
      instance, one can construct a single TextEnv which contains the
      output of a {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.txt.Mixup} program, plus some hand-labeled
      "ground truth" data, while still being able to re-run the
      program and get new output and/or edit the "ground truth".
      </ol>
