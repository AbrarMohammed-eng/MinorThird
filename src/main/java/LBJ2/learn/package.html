Learning algorithms, normalizers (used in inference; see
{@link LBJ2.learn.Normalizer}), testing metrics (used in cross validation; see
{@link LBJ2.learn.TestingMetric}), and other utility classes can be found in
this package.

<p> Learning algorithms are always associated with an evaluation algorithm
that actually does the classifying; the learning algorithm simply sets the
parameters of that classifying function.  Thus, they are implemented here as
{@link LBJ2.classify.Classifier}s that can change their representations (i.e.,
their parameters) given training data.
