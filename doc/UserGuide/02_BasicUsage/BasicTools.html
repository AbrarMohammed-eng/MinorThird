These annotations may be pre-existing (as embedded XML) or may have been created using MinorThird. One of useful feature of this tool is that it allows you to compare two different kinds of labels (called Span Types). For instance if you want to know what parts of your data an annotator has trouble with, you can graphically compare the predictions to what actually should have been labeled. The syntax to invoke this tool is: </p><p><center><em>java edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.EditLabels -labels &lt;directory containing documents&gt; </em></center></p><p>For a detailed description of the capabilities of this tool see the <a href="../../Tutorials/EditLabels/EditLabels_Tutorial.html">EditLabels Tutorial</a></p></body></html>
