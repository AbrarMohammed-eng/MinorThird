Using the scp client on your machine you may upload content to your
project web space by using the following path as your destination:
username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/p/pr/projectname/htdocs

Whereby you replace username with the username you use to login to the
SourceForge.net web site, and you replace p/pr/projectname with the
UNIX name of your project, preceded by the first; and first and second
letters of that project name. For instance, if your username is
myusername and your project name is foobar, you would use the
following as your destination path for SCP:
myusername@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/f/fo/foobar/htdocs
