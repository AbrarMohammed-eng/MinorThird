However, if you plan on compiling MinorThird yourself, making additions to the apis or using them in your software, then you will need the full java SDK as well as the <a href="http://ant.apache.org" target="_blank">ant</a> java build utility.

The basic steps to conducting an experiment  are: train an annotator (classifier or extractor) on sample data, run this annotator on test data and analyze its performance, change the settings and repeat to find the best, and finally apply the best annotator on the &quot;real&quot; data of interest to answer the original question. There are two ways to execute these streps in MinorThird:</p>	<ol>		<li>Use the provided MinorThird UI tools to directly conduct an experiment. MinorThird provides many tools for executing one or more of the steps in the experiment process as well as  utilities that cobmine some of the steps to make the process a little easier. All MinorThird tools are invoked via the command line, but can be used in one of two ways: Graphically or Command Line.	    		  <ul>		    <li>To use the graphical version of any tool simply supply the <em>-gui</em> argument to command. Execute the following command for an example:		      <p><em>java edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TrainExtractor  -gui</em></p>		    </li>          </ul>		  <blockquote>		    <p>A window should appear. This window is the main experiment control window for all GUI apps in Minorthird. In the top section (labeled <em>Parameter modification</em>) it shows what program is being executed. Pressing the <em>Edit</em> button allows you to adjust the parameters of the program. The middle section contains the buttons that control the experiment. Once you have set all the options in the top section, you press <em>Start Task</em> to execute the program you have chosen to run. Any output that the program generates will be printed to the bottom section labeled <em>Error messages and output</em>. Finally, once the execution is complete the View Results button will be enabled. Clicking on this button will pop up a window that shows the results of your experiment. These controls are the same for virtually every program in theMinorthird suite.</p>	      </blockquote>		  <ul>		    <li>Other arguments may be provided on the command line in addition to <em>-gui</em>. The invoked program will read the provided values and pre-populate the fields in the GUI. Execute the following command so see this in action. Once the window appears, click on the <em>Edit</em> button and notice that the field named <em>labelsFilename</em> in the <em>baseParameters</em> section is populated with the value supplied to the <em>-labels</em> argument on the command line. </li>	      </ul>		  <blockquote>		    <p><em>java edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TrainExtractor -labels sample1.train -gui</em></p>	      </blockquote>		  <ul><li>To see the list of all possible arguments that a tool accepts simply provide the <em>-help</em> argument. </li>		  </ul>		</li>		<blockquote>		  <p><em>java edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TrainExtractor -help</em></p>	  </blockquote>		<ul>		  <li>Once you are comfortable setting up experiments in the GUI, you will probably want to just supply all the parameters on the command line and skip the GUI altogether. Keep in mind that each tool has a set of minimal parameters required for proper execution. All of the arguments listed using <em>-help</em>, that are  enclosed in square brackets ('[' and ']') are OPTIONAL, the rest are required. Running from the command line is best demonstrated with the following examples:</li>		</ul>		<blockquote>		  <p><em>java edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TrainExtractor -labels sample1.train -spanType trueName -saveAs sample1.ann</em> <br>		  <em>java edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TestExtractor -labels sample1.test -spanType trueName -loadFrom sample1.ann</em></p>		  <p>The first command trains an annotator on the <em>sample1.train</em> dataset (this is a built-in dataset) and saves it in the current directory as <em>sample1.ann</em>. The <em>-spanType</em> argument tells the program to train the annotator to label spans of tokens that it thinks correspond to instances of <em>trueName</em>. The <em>sample1.train</em> dataset contains examples of these instances that are used to train the annotator. The second command tests this trained annotator (specified using the <em>-loadFrom</em> argument) against the sample1.test dataset (also a built-in dataset) and prints the performance to the screen. In this command the <em>-spanType</em> argument tells the program which labels to compare the annotators predictions to and in this case our testing dataset has its examples named the same as the training dataset (this is NOT required). </p>	    </blockquote>		<ul>		  <li>A complete list of all the programs available in the Minorthird application suite can be found <a href="UserGuide/99_Reference/ApplicationList.html">here</a>. </li>          <li>Step by step instructions on how  to use each of these tools is available in the <a href="Tutorials.html">tutorials</a> section. </li>	  </ul>      <blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>	    <li>Use the MinorThird libraries inside a custom java application to conduct experiments and analyze the results.The most powerful way to utilize the capabilities of Minorthird is to create, run and evaluate experiments inside your own custom application. </li>        <ul>          <li>Some of the specific advantages of using Minorthird in this way are            <ul>              <li>It allows you to present the Minorthird tools to a user as an integrated part of your application, with an interface that makes sense in the context of your application.</li>              <li>It allows you to automatically run multiple experiments concurrently or in succession using the results of a previous experiment to derive the parameters for the next.</li>              <li>You can automate the experiment process eliminating the need for human intervention.</li>              <li>You can store the results of experiments (statistics or annotations) in any form you choose (ie. custom file format or relational database) instead of just the supported Minorthird formats.</li>              <li></li>            </ul>          </li>		  <li>The Minorthird API is broken up into 4 main packages:	        <ol>	          <li>edu.cmu.minorthird.classify.* - </li>              <li>edu.cmu.minorthird.text.* - </li>	          <li>edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.* - </li>	          <li>edu.cmu.minorthird.util.* - </li>            </ol>		  </li>		  <li>See the <a href="http://minorthird.sourceforge.net/javadoc/index.html">javadocs</a> for a detailed description of the complete Minorthird API specification.</li>          <li>The basic steps to performing an experiment using the Minorthird API are:            <ol>              <li>Load your data into a TextBase (extractor) or a DataSet (classifier).</li>              <li>Instantiate an AnnotatorTeacher (extractor) or ClassifierTeacher (classifier).</li>              <li>Configure the teacher.</li>              <li>Instantiate an instance of AnnotatorLearner (extractor) or ClassifierLearner (classifier) the represents the desired learner algorithm.</li>              <li>Configure the learner.</li>              <li>Call teacher.train(learner) to create a trained extractor or classifier.</li>            </ol>          </li>		  <li> See the <a href="UserGuide/70_APIGuide/APIMain.html">UserGuide</a> for a more detailed explanation on using the Minorthird API.</li>        </ul>    </ol></div></body></html>
